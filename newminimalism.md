## new minimalism

I felt the bulk of all my worldly goods quite forcefully last month when I almost tipped over the 26-foot, two-ton truck that contained them. After sweating my way through the narrow streets and rush hour traffic of St. Louis and riding the brakes down the slopes of the Ozarks, the most frightening moment of our family's move came in the final 200 feet, on the private drive leading to our new house. Our sloping gravel driveway terminates by curving between a ravine and a drainage ditch at a point that, as it turns out, is not wide enough for the largest truck you can get from Budget. Accordingly, I rolled one set of the rear tires through the drainage ditch, tearing a large chunk out of the lawn and causing the fully loaded truck (and my heart) to buck and twist like a leaping orca. 

Moving could make a minimalist out of Louis XIV. The sentence escaped my lips more than once, as we packed and cleaned and organized: "*Why* do we have so much *stuff*?" The blisters left on my hands by many cardboard boxes, and the gouge left in my lawn by the moving truck, testify that my life could use some cleaning up. Marie Kondo and other gurus of minimalism and de-cluttering would tell me all this could have been avoided if I had just tossed everything that doesn't "spark joy" or serve to fill my basic needs. Perhaps, in addition to giving away our piano and a couple old bedframes, we should have ditched a few of those 30 boxes of books, or a couple more kitchen appliances. Maybe I could have got us down to the much less terrifying 16-foot truck.

Scripture itself seems to encourage me to stop toting so many possessions through this life, not least through the example of Jesus himself, who doesn't appear in the Gospels to own much of anything. Few would dispute that Christians ought to resist unchecked consumerism, of course: a critique of acquisitiveness and waste is one point upon which Christians of most traditions agree, from [Pope Francis](http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/08/05/pope-denounces-comsumerism-as-a-poison/) to Presbyterian theologian [Carl Trueman](http://qideas.org/articles/consumerism-and-the-church-an-interview-with-carl-trueman/). To the degree that minimalist philosophy serves that end, it can be valuable to individual Christians. 

Consumerism, however, is a subtle demon, and it may not be readily exorcised just through the practice of what [*The New York Times* called "the oppressive gospel" of minimalism](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/magazine/the-oppressive-gospel-of-minimalism.html). The minimalism of Kondo and the de-clutterers may help individuals lessen consumeristic behaviors in their own lives, but it does not reckon with the deeper spiritual effects of consumerism, nor its wider social effects. De-cluttering, then, is a practice both shallow and narrow, falling short of a fully formed Christian attitude toward the stuff that fills our lives and moving trucks. Though minimalism is preferable to careless consumerism, Christians must aim for a richer account of consumption and possession, one that reckons more fully with how we shape God's creation through our getting, having, and disposing.

### Sparking Joy



God likes matter, so it's appropriate for *stuff* to bring us joy

Kondo's process

Two cheers for keeping good stuff, not junk

### The Restlessness of Organization

Cavanaugh:

“What really characterizes consumer culture is not attachment to things but detachment. People do not hoard money; they spend it. People do not cling to things; they discard them and buy other things.”  

“Consumerism is not so much about having more as it is about having something else; that’s why it is not simply buying but shopping that is the heart of consumerism. Buying brings a temporary halt to the restlessness that typifies consumerism.”

### My Decluttering, Your Cluttering

Trash crisis

Decluttering is ultimately an individual solution that may compound social problems

### Living in a Holy Clutter

Decluttering pushes toward the clean, convenient, smooth experience of buying the optimal goods on Amazon or IKEA

Perhaps we ought instead to live in a holy clutter of patched up, good enough
