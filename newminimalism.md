## new minimalism

I felt the bulk of all my worldly goods quite forcefully last month when I almost tipped over the two-ton moving truck that contained them. After sweating my way through the narrow streets of St. Louis and riding the brakes down the slopes of the Ozarks, the most frightening moment of my time as amateur trucker came in the final 200 feet, on the private drive leading to our new house. Our narrow, sloping gravel driveway terminates by curving between a ravine and a drainage ditch at a point that, as it turns out, is not wide enough for the largest truck you can get from Budget. Accordingly, I rolled one set of the rear tires through the ditch, tearing a large chunk out of the lawn and causing the fully loaded truck, and my heart, to buck and twist like a leaping orca. 

I might have avoided this near-disaster more easily if I had followed the advice of Marie Kondo and the minimalist lifestyle movement. Instead of filling a truck with boxes of paperbacks, children's toys, and kitchen utensils, my family should have tossed everything we don't truly love. In addition to giving away some of the bulkiest and least useful of our possessions--our $50 piano, an old bedframe, homemade tomato cages---we should have effected a more radical purge. If we had done so, we would be happier, less stressed, and more spiritual. More importantly, we could have rented the much less terrifying 16-foot truck.

Kondo and other advocates of the less-is-more lifestyle offer their followers a self-help program tinged with the moral concern of anti-consumerist literature. Rather than simply offering to make me happier, it offers to make me better--this by helping me resist the corrosive effects of consumerism. It is not entirely novel in that program. Anti-consumerism goes back arguably as far as the works of Henry David Thoreau and John Ruskin in the 19th century, and the 20th and 21st centuries have seen one new attack on consumerism after another, from Naomi Klein's critique of advertising to the back-to-the-land proposals of new agrarian thinkers. Christians have frequently denounced consumerism as well, from [Pope Francis](http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/08/05/pope-denounces-comsumerism-as-a-poison/) to Reformed theologian [Carl Trueman](http://qideas.org/articles/consumerism-and-the-church-an-interview-with-carl-trueman/).

Minimalism offers its acolytes a means of self-improvement through organization, but it also inflects that program of personal benefits with social benefits: minimalists consume less and waste less, and thus contribute to increasing sustainability and social equity. The design group New Minimalism describes their practice as supporting ["sustainable, intentional living"](http://www.newminimalism.com/the-book/). So I not only avoid the bulk of an over-loaded moving truck, on this account, but I avoid damaging the earth with excess consumption of resources. 

The minimalist movement does distinguish itself from other anti-consumerist programs through its lighter tone. While anti-consumerists have often been strident, prophetic, or even dour, minimalist works tend to sound a more encouraging note. Kondo, as the guiding light of the movement, stresses achieving joy over feeling of shame, responsibility, or fear. Although this no doubt reflects to an extent the origins of the movement in popular self-help literature, for those genuinely concered about the effects of consumerism this change in attitude is not to be scorned. Those who cannot be motivated by the tears of the prophets may yet be provoked to act by the gentle encouragement and pleasing design sensibility of the minimalists.

Yet it's questionable whether minimalism really succeeds as an anti-consumerist movement.




Scripture itself seems to encourage me to stop toting so many possessions through this life, not least through the example of Jesus himself, who doesn't appear in the Gospels to own much of anything.  To the degree that minimalist philosophy serves that end, it can be valuable to individual Christians. 

Consumerism, however, is a subtle demon, and it may not be readily exorcised just through the practice of what [*The New York Times* called "the oppressive gospel" of minimalism](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/magazine/the-oppressive-gospel-of-minimalism.html). The minimalism of Kondo and the de-clutterers may help individuals lessen consumeristic behaviors in their own lives, but it does not reckon with the deeper spiritual effects of consumerism, nor its wider social effects. De-cluttering, then, is a practice both shallow and narrow, falling short of a fully formed Christian attitude toward the stuff that fills our lives and moving trucks. Though minimalism is preferable to careless consumerism, Christians must aim for a richer account of consumption and possession, one that reckons more fully with how we shape God's creation through our getting, having, and disposing.

### Sparking Joy



God likes matter, so it's appropriate for *stuff* to bring us joy

Two cheers for keeping good stuff, not junk

### The Restlessness of Organization

Cavanaugh:

“What really characterizes consumer culture is not attachment to things but detachment. People do not hoard money; they spend it. People do not cling to things; they discard them and buy other things.”  

“Consumerism is not so much about having more as it is about having something else; that’s why it is not simply buying but shopping that is the heart of consumerism. Buying brings a temporary halt to the restlessness that typifies consumerism.”

### My Decluttering, Your Cluttering

Trash crisis

Decluttering is ultimately an individual solution that may compound social problems

### Living in a Holy Clutter

Decluttering pushes toward the clean, convenient, smooth experience of buying the optimal goods on Amazon or IKEA

Perhaps we ought instead to live in a holy clutter of patched up, good enough
